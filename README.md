# Scripts and Snips Library for Tabletop Simulator

This is my github where I store my Scripts and Snips library for TTS. Your welcome to use it as you like for any purpose. I have recently moved to doing my mods on gitHub and they all use these files and will not work without them.

## Intructioins
clone the github or download the zipped version and unarchive into a directory. Then in Atom (I use Atom and do not know how to set this up for other IDEs) go to the plugin settings for the Tabletop Simulator Plugin and edit the "includes dir" to be the root of the directory where you have localy stored these files.

This is very much work in progress and will be going through a lot of changes... I'm not a programmer but self-taught as I learned modding.. so I get that it is a total mess and could be a real pain for others to read and cause actual pain to people that know what they are doing. Still, it is what it is!

Have Fun and ROLL HIGH<br>
